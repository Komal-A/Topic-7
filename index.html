			 <p>Henna/Mehndi has been used since antiquity to dye skin, hair and fingernails, as well as fabrics including silk, wool and leather. Historically, henna/Mehndi was used in the Arabian Peninsula, Indian subcontinent, Near and Middle East, Carthage, other parts of North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Henna/Mehndi can also refer to the temporary body art resulting from the staining of the skin from the dyes. After henna stains reach their peak color, they hold for a few days, then gradually wear off by way of exfoliation, typically within one to three weeks.</p>
